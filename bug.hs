This Haskell code attempts to use a polymorphic function with an ambiguous type signature. The function `mysteryFunction` lacks sufficient type information, leading to a compile-time error.  The compiler cannot infer a specific type for `a` because it's used in different contexts with no unifying constraint. 
```haskell
mysteryFunction :: a -> b -> a
mysteryFunction x y = x

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let result1 = mysteryFunction 5 10
  let result2 = mysteryFunction "hello" "world"
  print result1 -- ambiguous type variable `a`
  print result2 -- ambiguous type variable `a`
```
