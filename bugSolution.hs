The solution is to provide more specific type information to the function by adding type constraints or by using more concrete type signatures.

```haskell
mysteryFunction :: Num a => a -> b -> a
mysteryFunction x y = x

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let result1 = mysteryFunction 5 10
  print result1
  --let result2 = mysteryFunction "hello" "world" --This will now produce a compile-time error because strings are not instances of Num
```

This revised version specifies that `a` must be a member of the `Num` typeclass. This resolves the ambiguity for numerical inputs.  For string inputs, a separate function with a different type signature would be needed.
